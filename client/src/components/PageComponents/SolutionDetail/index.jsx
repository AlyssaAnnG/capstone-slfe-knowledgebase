                <p>
                    Hannah Gerlof and her brother Hannes noticed a brownfield site with 0,03ha barrack, after 17month of negotiation they  leased it from property management firm BIM (Berliner Immobilien Management GmbH). In the meantime, a project group had build around them being able to finance the lease together. Through many planning meetings and successfully aquired funding, they started working onsite in Jan 2017 (communal event cleaning the site with neighbours and other interested people). They connected to the national Permaculture institute as a practice site allowing wider recognition.
